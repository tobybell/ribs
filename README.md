# Ribs

A simple, fast reactive web framework that enhances native DOM APIs instead of trying to supplant them.

The core idea in Ribs is to make it easy to configure imperative DOM APIs to react automatically and granularly to changes in mutable data. This ends up looking very different from a model like React, where entire branches of a UI are re-generated in response to small changes. It is more performant than React, without sacrificing ease of use. (Well, so I think. I am obviously biased.)
